# data-structure-and-algorithm-lab

This is my DSA lab work. DSA appears to be a "worthy opponent" in programming, because Programming Funndamentals and OOP were shit and easy af.
Im planning to write a lot about data structures & algorithms on my own website [gameidea](https://gameidea.org). For example, I have wrote some good stuff about [dijkstra algorithm](https://gameidea.org/2023/11/30/pathfinding-using-dijkstras-algorithm/) & [a* algorithm](https://gameidea.org/2023/12/04/pathfinding-using-a-algorithm/). Now I am planning to write about all the topics they taught me in DSA lab & theory. Maybe a single long post or in multiple posts.
